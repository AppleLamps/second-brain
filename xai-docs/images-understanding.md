#### Model Capabilities

# Image Understanding

When sending images, it is advised to not store request/response history on the server. Otherwise the request may fail.
See .

Some models allow images in the input. The model will consider the image context when generating the response.

## Constructing the message body - difference from text-only prompt

The request message to image understanding is similar to text-only prompt. The main difference is that instead of text input:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What is in this image?"
  }
]
```

We send in `content` as a list of objects:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "input_image",
        "image_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,<base64_image_string>",
        "detail": "high"
      },
      {
        "type": "input_text",
        "text": "What is in this image?"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The `image_url.url` can also be the image's url on the Internet.

### Image understanding example
